The following are the links to our public Docker Hub Repositories for our Docker Images:
User Microservice: https://hub.docker.com/r/felixzzh/csc3104-team25-user
Booking Microservice: https://hub.docker.com/r/felixzzh/csc3104-team25-booking
Occupancy Microservice: https://hub.docker.com/r/felixzzh/csc3104-team25-occupancy
Machine Learning Microservice: https://hub.docker.com/r/felixzzh/csc3104-team25-ml
Web Client Service: https://hub.docker.com/r/leooh29/csc3104-web-service

When deploying the pods to the Kubernetes cluster, there is NO NEED to build these images as the images will be automatically pulled from the Repositories 
(as specified in their respective .yaml deployment files)

Alternatively, you can run "docker-compose up --build" to build and run the container images.
(Run this command in the main folder with the docker-compose.yml)
